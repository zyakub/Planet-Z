Homework for Class 3

1. The data appears to be structured to keep track of information relative to orders from

customers at Chipotle. There is an order_id that acts as a PK however this does not seem to 

be unique per each row as each order can have many items. Next there is the Quantity of 

the item being ordered, the Item itself and a Description column to describe the Item where 

applicable.
head chipotle.tsv
tail chipotle.tsv

2. There appears to be 1834 orders.
3. 4623 lines in the file
wc -l chipotle.tsv
4. 553 Orders of Chicken Burrito as opposed to 368 orders of Steak burrito
code - grep -i 'chicken burrito' chipotle.tsv | wc -l and compare with the count for grep -i 'steak burrito' chipotle.tsv | wc -l
5. Black beans
code - rep -i 'chicken burrito' chipotle.tsv | grep -i 'black beans' | wc -l with grep -i 'chicken burrito' chipotle.tsv | grep -i 'pinto beans' | wc -l
