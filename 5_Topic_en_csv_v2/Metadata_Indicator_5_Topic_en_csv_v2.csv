"EG.GDP.PUSE.KO.PP","GDP per unit of energy use (PPP $ per kg of oil equivalent)","GDP per unit of energy use is the PPP GDP per kilogram of oil equivalent of energy use. PPP GDP is gross domestic product converted to current international dollars using purchasing power parity rates based on the 2011 ICP round. An international dollar has the same purchasing power over GDP as a U.S. dollar has in the United States.","IEA Statistics © OECD/IEA 2012 (http://www.iea.org/stats/index.asp), subject to https://www.iea.org/t&c/termsandconditions/",
"EG.GDP.PUSE.KO.PP.KD","GDP per unit of energy use (constant 2011 PPP $ per kg of oil equivalent)","GDP per unit of energy use is the PPP GDP per kilogram of oil equivalent of energy use. PPP GDP is gross domestic product converted to 2011 constant international dollars using purchasing power parity rates. An international dollar has the same purchasing power over GDP as a U.S. dollar has in the United States.","IEA Statistics © OECD/IEA 2012 (http://www.iea.org/stats/index.asp), subject to https://www.iea.org/t&c/termsandconditions/",
"EG.IMP.CONS.ZS","Energy imports, net (% of energy use)","Net energy imports are estimated as energy use less production, both measured in oil equivalents. A negative value indicates that the country is a net exporter. Energy use refers to use of primary energy before transformation to other end-use fuels, which is equal to indigenous production plus imports and stock changes, minus exports and fuels supplied to ships and aircraft engaged in international transport.","IEA Statistics © OECD/IEA 2012 (http://www.iea.org/stats/index.asp), subject to https://www.iea.org/t&c/termsandconditions/",

"EG.USE.COMM.GD.PP.KD","Energy use (kg of oil equivalent) per $1,000 GDP (constant 2011 PPP)","Energy use per PPP GDP is the kilogram of oil equivalent of energy use per constant PPP GDP. Energy use refers to use of primary energy before transformation to other end-use fuels, which is equal to indigenous production plus imports and stock changes, minus exports and fuels supplied to ships and aircraft engaged in international transport. PPP GDP is gross domestic product converted to 2011 constant international dollars using purchasing power parity rates.
